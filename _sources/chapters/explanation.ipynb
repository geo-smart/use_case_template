    "# Creating Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation (Science or Utility)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the science motivation, data challenge and any existing attempts. Explain why you need ML to solve the problem as opposed to a conventional approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Methods and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the method and why you think it's suitable for your use case. Explain the choice of tools/packages/data and the reason for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data description include source, size, type, attributes, modality, etc. Data retrieval from community data centers, personal cloud storage, or published datasets. Feature extraction and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Development and Paramter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the effects of parameter tuning and how it was performed. If you used a tool to perform automatic tuning , explaing that as well. If it is the case, explain model under or over fitting and the consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how you split the data into training, testing and validation sets. Explore feature importance. Save the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing of the model on independent datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Management\n",
    "\n",
    "If you seek to make the model run in production or achieve higher productivity and scalability, use GeoWeaver or other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "How to get credit for the work. Steps for getting a DOI. Discuss workflow adaptation to other datasets and science questions if suitable."
